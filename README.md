This is a prototype showing how to integrate tinymce into Qt with QWebEngine.

Tested on Windows with MSVC 2015 Build Tools and QtCreator.

The tinymce.zip is a hacked version of tinymce, where some plugins are added in order to communicate with Qt. It needs to be placed into the same folder as the executable.
