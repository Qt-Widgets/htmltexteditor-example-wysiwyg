# htmltexteditor-example

This is a prototype showing how to integrate tinymce into Qt with QWebEngine, as described in this blog post:
http://meetingcpp.com/index.php/br/items/refactoring-the-html-text-editor-for-qwebengine.html

Tested on Windows with MSVC 2015 Build Tools and QtCreator.

The tinymce.zip is a hacked version of tinymce, where some plugins are added in order to communicate with Qt. It needs to be placed into the same folder as the executable.

The shared folder is from the Qt Examples:
